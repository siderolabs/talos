    [notes.equinixMetal]
        title = "Equinix Metal Platform"
        description="""\
`talos.platform` for Equinix Metal is renamed from `packet` to `equinixMetal`, the older name is still supported for backwards compatibility.
"""

    [notes.applyconfig]
        title = "Apply Config Enhancements"
        description="""\
`talosctl apply/patch/edit` cli commands got revamped.
Separate flags `--on-reboot`, `--immediate`, `--interactive` were replaced
with a single `--mode` flag that can take the following values:
- `auto` new mode that automatically applies the configuration in immediate/reboot mode.
- `no-reboot` force apply immediately, if not possible, then fail.
- `reboot` force reboot with apply config.
- `staged` write new machine configuration to STATE, but don't apply it (it will be applied after a reboot).
- `interactive` starts interactive installer, only for `apply`.
"""

    [notes.kubelet]
        title = "Kubelet"
        description="""\
Kubelet configuration can now be overridden with the `.machine.kubelet.extraConfig` machine configuration field.
As most of the kubelet command line arguments are being depreacted, it is recommended to migrate to `extraConfig`
instead of using `extraArgs`.

A number of conformance tweaks have been made to the `kubelet` to allow it to run without
`protectKernelDefaults`.
This includes both kubelet configuration options and sysctls.
Of particular note is that Talos now sets the `kernel.panic` reboot interval to 10s instead of 1s.
If your kubelet fails to start after the upgrade, please check the `kubelet` logs to determine the problem.
"""

    [notes.auditlog]
        title = "API Server Audit Logs"
        description="""\
`kube-apiserver` is now configured to store its audit logs separately from the `kube-apiserver` standard logs and directly to file.
The `kube-apiserver` will maintain the rotation and retirement of these logs, which are stored in `/var/log/audit/`.
Previously, the audit logs were sent to `kube-apiserver`'s `stdout`, along with the rest of its logs, to be collected in the usual manner by Kubernetes.

* Kubernetes: 1.23.4
* CoreDNS: 1.9.0
* etcd: 3.5.2
* containerd: 1.6.0

"""

    [notes.wipe]
        title = "Wipe System Kernel Parameter"
        description="""\
Added new kernel parameter `talos.experimental.wipe=system` which can help resetting system disk for the machine
and start over with a fresh installation.
See [Resetting a Machine](https://www.talos.dev/docs/v0.15/guides/resetting-a-machine/#kernel-parameter) on how to use it.
"""

    [notes.machine_config]
        title = "Machine Configuration"
        description="""\
Talos now preserves machine configuration as it was submitted to the node.
"""

    [notes.platforms]
        title = "Platform Support"
        description="""\
Talos now supports Oracle Cloud.

Platform network configuration was rewritten to avoid modifying Talos machine configuration.
Network configuration is performed independent of the machine configuration presence, so it works
even if Talos is booted in maintenance mode (without machine configuration is platform userdata).
"""

    [notes.sbcs]
        title = "SBC Support"
        description="""\
Talos now supports Jetson Nano SBC.
"""

    [notes.system_extensions]
        title = "System Extensions"
        description="""\
System extensions allow extending Talos root filesystem, which enables a set of different features, including custom
container runtimes, additional firmware, etc.

System extensions are only activated during Talos installation (or upgrade), and with system extensions installed, Talos
root filesystem is still immutable and read-only.

Please see [extensions repository](https://github.com/talos-systems/extensions) and [documentation](https://www.talos.dev/docs/v0.15/guides/system-extensions/) for more information.
"""

    [notes.patching]
        title = "Machine Configuration Patching"
        description="""\
`talosctl` commands which accept JSON patches (`gen config`, `cluster create`, `patch machineconfig`) now support multiple patches, loading patches
from files with `@file.json` syntax, and support loading from YAML format.
"""

    [notes.staticpods]
        title = "Static Pods in the Machine Configuration"
        description="""\
Talos now accepts static pod definitions in the `.machine.pods` key of the machine configuration.
Please note that static pod definitions are not validated by Talos.
Static pod definitions can be updated without a node reboot.
"""

    [notes.k8sversion]
        title = "Pinned Kubernets Version"
        description="""\
Command `talosctl gen config` now defaults to Kubernetes version pinning in the generate machine configuration.
Previously default was to omit explicit Kubernetes version, so Talos picked up the default version it was built against.
Old behavior can be achieved by specifiying empty flag value: `--kubernetes-version=`.
"""

    [notes.admission]
        title = "Admission Plugin Configuration"
        description="""\
Talos now supports Kubernetes API server admission plugin configuration via the `.cluster.apiServer.admissonControl` machine configuration field.

This configuration can be used to enable [Pod Security Admission](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/) plugin and
define cluster-wide default [Pod Security Standards](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/).
"""

    [notes.psp]
        title = "Pod Security Policy"
        description="""\
Pod Security Policy Kubernetes feature is deprecated and is going to be removed in Kubernetes 1.25.
Talos by default skips setting up PSP now (see machine configuration `.cluster.apiServer.disablePodSecurityPolicy`).
"""

    [notes.extservices]
        title = "Extension Services"
        description = """\
Talos now provides a way to extend set of system services Talos runs with extension services.
Extension services should be included in the Talos root filesystem (e.g. via system extensions).
"""

    [notes.sysfs]
        title = "Sysfs Kernel Parameters"
        description="""\
Talos now supports setting `sysfs` kernel parameters  (`/sys/...`).
Use machine configuration field `.machine.sysfs` to set `sysfs` kernel parameters.
