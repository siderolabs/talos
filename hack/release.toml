The command `talosctl cluster create` now enables IPv6 by default for the Docker containers
created for Talos nodes. This allows to use IPv6 addresses in Kubernetes networking.

If `talosctl cluster create` fails to work on Linux due to the lack of IPv6 support,
please use the flag `--disable-docker-ipv6` to revert the change.
