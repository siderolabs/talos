        description="""\
`talosctl apply/patch/edit` cli commands got revamped.
Separate flags `--on-reboot`, `--immediate`, `--interactive` were replaced
with a single `--mode` flag that can take the following values:
- `auto` new mode that automatically applies the configuration in immediate/reboot mode.
- `no-reboot` force apply immediately, if not possible, then fail.
- `reboot` force reboot with apply config.
- `staged` write new machine configuration to STATE, but don't apply it (it will be applied after a reboot).
- `interactive` starts interactive installer, only for `apply`.
