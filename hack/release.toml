Talos Linux now supports `physical: true` qualifier for device selectors, it selects non-virtual network interfaces (i.e. `en0` is selected, while `bond0` is not).

    [notes.dns-resolve-cache]
        title = "DNS Caching"
        description = """\
Talos Linux now  provides a caching DNS resolver for host workloads (including host networking pods). It can be disabled with:

```yaml
machine:
  features:
    hostDNS:
      enabled: false
```

You can also enable dns caching for k8s pods with:

```yaml
machine:
  features:
    hostDNS:
      enabled: true
      forwardKubeDNSToHost: true
```

Please note that on running cluster you will have to kill CoreDNS pods for this change to apply.

Talos Linux now provides a way to configure systemd-boot ISO 'secure-boot-enroll' option while generating a SecureBoot ISO image:

```yaml
output:
    kind: iso

Talos Linux starting from this release uses RSA key for Kubernetes API Server Service Account instead of ECDSA key to provide better compatibility with external OpenID Connect implementations.

    [notes.extensions]
        title = "Extension Services Config"
        description = """\
Talos now supports supplying configuration files and environment variables for extension services.
The extension service configuration is a separate config document. An example is shown below:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1alpha1
kind: ExtensionServiceConfig
name: nut-client
configFiles:
  - content: MONITOR ${upsmonHost} 1 remote pass password
    mountPath: /usr/local/etc/nut/upsmon.conf
environment:
  - UPS_NAME=ups
```

For documentation, see [Extension Services Config Files](https://www.talos.dev/v1.7/reference/configuration/extensions/extensionserviceconfig/).

**Note**: The use of `environmentFile` in extension service spec is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release of Talos.
Use `ExtensionServiceConfig` instead.

The command `talosctl upgrade-k8s` now supports specifying custom image references for Kubernetes components via `--*-image` flags.
The default behavior is unchanged, and the flags are optional.

    [notes.kubespan]

        description = """\
Talos Linux disables by default a KubeSpan feature to harvest additional endpoints from KubeSpan members.
This feature turned out to be less helpful than expected and caused unnecessary performance issues.

Previous behavior can be restored with:

```yaml
machine:
  network:
    kubespan:
        harvestExtraEndpoints: true
```

    [notes.sbc]
        title = "SBC"
        description = """\
Talos has split the SBC's (Single Board Computers) into separate repositories.
There will not be any more SBC specific release assets as part of Talos release.

The default Talos Installer image will stop working for SBC's and will fail the upgrade, if used, starting from Talos v1.7.0.

The SBC's images and installers can be generated on the fly using [Image Factory](https://factory.talos.dev) or using [Imager](https://www.talos.dev/latest/talos-guides/install/boot-assets/) for custom images.
The list of official SBC's images supported by Image Factory can be found in the [Overlays](https://github.com/siderolabs/overlays/) repository.
"""

    [notes.syslog]
        title = "Syslog"
        description = """\
Talos Linux now starts a basic syslog receiver listening on `/dev/log`.
The receiver can mostly parse both RFC3164 and RFC5424 messages and writes them as JSON formatted message.
The logs can be viewed via `talosctl logs syslogd`.

This is mostly implemented for extension services that log to syslog.

    [notes.ntp]
        title = "Time Sync"
        description = """\
Default NTP server was updated to be `time.cloudflare.com` instead of `pool.ntp.org`.
Default server is only used if the user does not specify any NTP servers in the configuration.

Talos Linux can now sync to PTP devices (e.g. provided by the hypervisor) skipping the network time servers.
In order to activate PTP sync, set `machine.time.servers` to the PTP device name (e.g. `/dev/ptp0`):

```yaml
machine:
  time:
    servers:
      - /dev/ptp0
```

Talos Linux now supports hardware watchdog timers configuration.
If enabled, and the machine becomes unresponsive, the hardware watchdog will reset the machine.

Talos Linux now forces `kubelet` and `kube-proxy` to use `iptables-nft` instead of `iptables-legacy` (`xtables`) which was the default
before Talos 1.7.0.

Container images based on `iptables-wrapper` should work without changes, but if there was a direct call to `legacy` mode of `iptables`, make sure
to update to use `iptables-nft`.
