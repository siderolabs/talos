        title = "kube-apiserver Authorization Config"
        description = """\
When using `.cluster.apiServer.authorizationConfig` the user provided order for the authorizers is honoured and `Node` and `RBAC` authorizers are always added to the end if not explicitly specified.

Eg: If user provides only `Webhook` authorizer, the final order will be `Webhook`, `Node`, `RBAC`.

To provide a specific order for `Node` or `RBAC` explicitly, user can provide the authorizer in the order they want.

Eg:

```yaml
cluster:
  apiServer:
    authorizationConfig:
      - type: Node
        name: Node
      - type: Webhook
        name: Webhook
        webhook:
          connectionInfo:
            type: InClusterConfig
        ...
      - type: RBAC
        name: rbac
```

Usage of `authorization-mode` CLI argument will not support this form of customization.
