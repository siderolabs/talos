        description="""\
The command `talosctl cluster create` now enables IPv6 by default for the Docker containers
created for Talos nodes. This allows to use IPv6 addresses in Kubernetes networking.

If `talosctl cluster create` fails to work on Linux due to the lack of IPv6 support,
please use the flag `--disable-docker-ipv6` to revert the change.

[Pod Security Admission](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/) controller is enabled by default with the following policy:

Talos is built for x86-64 architecture with support for [x86-64-v2 microarchitecture level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Microarchitecture_levels),

If enabled it just prints out the selected config application mode and the configuration diff.
"""

    [notes.apply-config-try]
        title = "Apply Config `--mode=try`"
        description="""\
The commands `talosctl apply-config`, `talosctl patch mc` and `talosctl edit mc` now support the new mode called `try`.
In this mode the config change is applied for a period of time and then reverted back to the state it was before the change.
`--timeout` parameter can be used to customize the config rollback timeout.
This new mode can be used only with the parts of the config that can be changed without a reboot and can help to check that
the new configuration doesn't break the node.
Can be especially useful to check network interfaces changes that may lead to the loss of connectivity to the node.

    [notes.network-device-selector]

        description="""\
Talos machine configuration supports specifying network interfaces by selectors instead of interface name.
