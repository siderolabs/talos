By default new clusters will use secretbox for encryption instead of AESCBC.
If both are configured secretbox will take precedence.
Old clusters may keep using AESCBC.
To enable secretbox you may add an encryption secret at `cluster.secretboxEncryptionSecret`.
You should keep `aescbcEncryptionSecret` however, even if secretbox is enabled older data will still be encrypted with AESCBC.

How to generate the secret:

```bash
dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/stdout bs=32 count=1 | base64
```

Talos now internally handles etcd member removal by member ID instead of member name (hostname).
This resolves the case when member name is not accurate or empty (eg: when etcd hasn't fully joined yet).

Command `talosctl etcd remove-member` now accepts member IDs instead of member names.

New resource can be used to get member ID of the Talos node:

```bash
talosctl get etcdmember
```
