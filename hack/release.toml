Talos enables [--experimental-compact-hash-check-enabled](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/pull/14120) option by default to improve
etcd store consistency guarantees.

This options is only available with etcd >= v3.5.5, so Talos doesn't support version of etcd before v3.5.5.

The directory "/etc/kubernetes/manifests" is now deprecated.

By default new clusters will use secretbox for encryption instead of AESCBC.
If both are configured secretbox will take precedence.
Old clusters may keep using AESCBC.
To enable secretbox you may add an encryption secret at `cluster.secretboxEncryptionSecret`.
You should keep `aescbcEncryptionSecret` however, even if secretbox is enabled older data will still be encrypted with AESCBC.

How to generate the secret:

```bash
dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/stdout bs=32 count=1 | base64
```

    [notes.etcd-member-id]
        title = "etcd Member ID"
        description = """\
Talos now internally handles etcd member removal by member ID instead of member name (hostname).
This resolves the case when member name is not accurate or empty (eg: when etcd hasn't fully joined yet).

Command `talosctl etcd remove-member` now accepts member IDs instead of member names.

New resource can be used to get member ID of the Talos node:

```bash
talosctl get etcdmember
```

    [notes.cgroupsv1]
        title = "cgroups v1"
        description = """\
Talos defaults to using cgroups v2 when Talos doesn't run in a container (when running in a container
Talos follows host cgroups mode).
Talos can now be forced to use cgroups v1 by setting boot kernel argument `talos.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0`:

```yaml
machine:
  install:
    extraKernelArgs:
      - "talos.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=0"
```

Current cgroups mode can be checked with `talosctl ls /sys/fs/cgroup`:

cgroups v1:

```
blkio
cpu
cpuacct
cpuset
devices
freezer
hugetlb
memory
net_cls
net_prio
perf_event
pids
```

cgroups v2:

```
cgroup.controllers
cgroup.max.depth
cgroup.max.descendants
cgroup.procs
cgroup.stat
cgroup.subtree_control
cgroup.threads
cpu.stat
cpuset.cpus.effective
cpuset.mems.effective
init
io.stat
kubepods
memory.numa_stat
memory.stat
podruntime
system

> Note: `cgroupsv1` is deprecated and it should be used only for compatibility with workloads which don't support `cgroupsv2` yet.

Talos now supports specifying node labels in the machine configuration:

Changes to the node labels will be applied immediately without `kubelet` restart.

Talos keeps track of the owned node labels in the `talos.dev/owned-labels` annotation.
