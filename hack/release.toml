        description = """\
Node type `join` was renamed to `worker` for clarity. The old value is still accepted in the machine configuration but deprecated.
`talosctl gen config` now generates `worker.yaml` instead of `join.yaml`.

        description = """\
> **Note**: This item only applies to clusters bootstrapped with Talos <= 0.8.

Talos 0.12 completely removes support for self-hosted Kubernetes control plane (bootkube-based).
Talos 0.9 introduced support for Talos-managed control plane and provided migration path to convert self-hosted control plane
to Talos-managed static pods.
Automated and manual conversion process is available in Talos from 0.9.x to 0.11.x.
For clusters bootstrapped with bootkube (Talos <= 0.8), please make sure control plane is converted to Talos-managed before
before upgrading to Talos 0.12.
Current control plane status can be checked with `talosctl get bootstrapstatus` before performing upgrade to Talos 0.12.

        description = """\
Sysctl Kernel Params configuration was completely rewritten to be based on controllers and resources,
which makes it possible to apply `.machine.sysctls` in immediate mode (without a reboot).
`talosctl get kernelparams` returns merged list of KSPP, Kubernetes and user defined params along with
the default values overwritten by Talos.
