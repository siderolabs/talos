                it to    the Node, and finding the appropriate field in Node.Status.NodeInfo    (which
                uses different field names and formatting). 2) It removes some of
                the dependency on the structure of the Node,    so that if the structure
                of Node.Status.NodeInfo changes, only    machine controllers need
                to be updated, rather than every client    of the Machines API. 3)
                There is no other simple way to check the control plane    version.
                A client would have to connect directly to the apiserver    running

                        get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as a

                        required by autoscaler to be able to have a provider view
                        of the list of machines. Another list of nodes is queried
                        from the k8s apiserver and then a comparison is done to find
                        out unregistered machines and are marked for delete. This
