# Paths to exclude when searching for Protobuf files.
# These can either be file or directory names.
# If there is a directory name, that directory and all sub-directories will be excluded.
#excludes:
#  - path/to/a
#  - path/to/b/file.proto

# Protoc directives.
protoc:
  # The Protobuf version to use from https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases.
  # By default use 3.8.0.
  # You probably want to set this to make your builds completely reproducible.
  version: 3.15.3

  # Additional paths to include with -I to protoc.
  # By default, the directory of the config file is included,
  # or the current directory if there is no config file.
  includes:
    - vendor/
  # If not set, compile will fail if there are unused imports.
  # Setting this will ignore unused imports.

# Create directives.
#create:
# List of mappings from relative directory to base package.
# This affects how packages are generated with create.
#packages:
# This means that a file created "foo.proto" in the current directory will have package "bar".
# A file created "a/b/foo.proto" will have package "bar.a.b".
#- directory: .
#  name: bar
# This means that a file created "idl/code.uber/a/b/c.proto" will have package "uber.a.b".
#- directory: idl/code.uber

# Lint directives.
lint:
  # The lint group to use.
  # Available groups: "uber1", "uber2", "google", "empty".
  # The default group is the "uber1" lint group for backwards compatibility reasons,
  # however we recommend using the "uber2" lint group.
  # The special group "empty" has no linters, allowing you to manually specify all
  # lint rules in lint.rules.add.
  # Run prototool lint --list-all-lint-groups to see all available lint groups.
  # Run prototool lint --list-lint-group GROUP to list the linters in the given lint group.

  # Linter files to ignore.
  # These can either be file or directory names.

# The specific linters to add.
#    add:

# The specific linters to remove.
#    remove:
#      - ENUM_NAMES_CAMEL_CASE

# The path to the file header or the file header content for all Protobuf files.
# If either path or content is set and the FILE_HEADER linter is turned on,
# files will be checked to begin with the given header, and format --fix
# will place this header before the syntax declaration. Note that
# format --fix will delete anything before the syntax declaration
# if this is set.
#
# Set path to use a file's contents for the header. Path must be relative.
# Set content to directly specify the header.
# **Both path and content cannot be set at the same time. They are only done
# so here for example purposes.**
#
# If is_commented is set, this file is assumed to already have comments
# and will be added directly. If is_commented is not set, "// " will be
# added before every line.
#  file_header:
#    path: path/to/protobuf_file_header.txt
#    content: |
#      //
#      // Acme, Inc. (c) 2019
#      //
#    is_commented: true

# Breaking change detector directives.
#break:
# Include beta packages in breaking change detection.
# Beta packages have the form "foo.bar.vMAJORbetaBETA" where MAJOR > 0 and BETA > 0.
# By default, beta packages are ignored.
#include_beta: true
# Allow stable packages to depend on beta packages.
# By default, the breaking change detector will error if a stable package
# depends on a breaking package.
# If include_beta is true, this is implicitly set.
#allow_beta_deps: true

# Code generation directives.
#generate:
# Options that will apply to all plugins of type go and gogo.
#  go_options:
# The base import path. This should be the go path of the prototool.yaml file.
# This is required if you have any go plugins.
#    import_path: uber/foo/bar.git/idl/uber

# Extra modifiers to include with Mfile=package.
#    extra_modifiers:

#      google/api/http.proto: google.golang.org/genproto/googleapis/api/annotations

# The list of plugins.
#  plugins:
# The plugin name. This will go to protoc with --name_out, so it either needs
# to be a built-in name (like java), or a plugin name with a binary
# protoc-gen-name.
#    - name: gogo

# The type, if any. Valid types are go, gogo.
# Use go if your plugin is a standard Golang plugin
# that uses github.com/golang/protobuf imports, use gogo
# if it uses github.com/gogo/protobuf imports. For protoc-gen-go
# use go, For protoc-gen-gogo, protoc-gen-gogoslick, etc, use gogo.
#      type: gogo

# Extra flags to specify.
# The only flag you will generally set is plugins=grpc for Golang.
# The Mfile=package flags are automatically set.
# ** Otherwise, generally do not set this unless you know what you are doing. **
#      flags: plugins=grpc

# The path to output generated files to.
# If the directory does not exist, it will be created when running generation.
# This needs to be a relative path.
#      output: ../../.gen/proto/go

# Optional override for the plugin path. For example, if you set set path to
# /usr/local/bin/gogo_plugin", prototool will add the
# "--plugin=protoc-gen-gogo=/usr/local/bin/gogo_plugin" flag to protoc calls.
# If set to "gogo_plugin", prototool will search your path for "gogo_plugin",.
# and fail if "gogo_plugin" cannot be found.
#      path: gogo_plugin

#    - name: yarpc-go

#    - name: java
#      output: ../../.gen/proto/java

# Optional file suffix for plugins that output a single file as opposed
# to writing a set of files to a directory. This is only valid in two
# known cases:
# - For the java plugin, set this to "jar" to produce jars
#   https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/java-generated#invocation
# - For the descriptor_set plugin, this is required as using descriptor_set
#   requires a file to be given instead of a directory.
#      file_suffix: jar

# descriptor_set is special, and uses the --descriptor_set_out flag on protoc.
# file_suffix is required, and the options include_imports and include_source_info
# can be optionally set to add the flags --include_imports and --include_source-info.
# The include_imports and include_source_info options are not valid for any
# other plugin name.
