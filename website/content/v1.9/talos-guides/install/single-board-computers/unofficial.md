Certain single-board computers cannot be officially supported by Talos Linux due to the need for a custom fork of the Linux kernel.
This page provides a list of unofficial ports of Talos Linux to single-board computers, created and maintained by the community.
These ports are not officially supported by Talos Linux and are offered as-is.

Some of these ports may become official in the future.
