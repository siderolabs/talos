// Events represents the runtime event stream.
//
// Events internally is implemented as circular buffer of `runtime.Event`.
// `e.stream` slice is allocated to the initial capacity and slice size doesn't change
// throughout the lifetime of Events.
//
// To explain the internals, let's call `Publish()` method 'Publisher' (there might be
// multiple callers for it), and each `Watch()` handler as 'Consumer'.
//
// For Publisher, `Events` keeps `e.writePos`, `e.writePos` is write offset into `e.stream`.
// Offset `e.writePos` is always incremeneted, real write index is `e.writePos % e.cap`
//
// Each Consumer captures initial position it starts consumption from as `pos` which is
// local to each Consumer, as Consumers are free to work on their own pace. Following diagram shows
// Publisher and three Consumers:
//
//                                                 Consumer 3                         Consumer 2
//                                                 pos = 27                           pos = 34
//  e.stream []Event                               |                                  |
//                                                 |                                  |

//                                       pos = 43                           e.writePos = 50
//
// Capacity of Events in this diagram is 18, Publisher published already 50 events, so it
// already overwrote `e.stream` twice fully.
//
// Consumer1 is trying to keep up with the publisher, it has 14-7 = 7 events to catch up.
//
// Consumer2 is reading events published by Publisher before last wraparound, it has
// 50-34 = 16 events to catch up. Consumer 2 has a lot of events to catch up, but as it stays
// on track, it can still do that.
//
// Consumer3 is doing bad: 50-27 = 23 > 18 (capacity), so its read position has already been
// overwritten, it can't read consistent data,  soit should error out.
//
// Synchronization: at the moment single mutex protects `e.stream`  and `e.writePos`, consumers keep their
// position as local variable, so it doesn't require synchronization. If Consumer catches up with Publisher,
// it sleeps on condition variable to be woken up by Publisher on next publish.
