**Talos** is a modern OS for running Kubernetes: secure, immutable, and minimal.
Talos is fully open source, production-ready, and supported by the people at [Sidero Labs](https://www.SideroLabs.com/).
All system management is done via an API - there is no shell or interactive console.
Benefits include:

- **Security**: Talos reduces your attack surface: It's minimal, hardened, and immutable.
  All API access is secured with mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication.
- **Predictability**: Talos eliminates configuration drift, reduces unknown factors by employing immutable infrastructure ideology, and delivers atomic updates.
- **Evolvability**: Talos simplifies your architecture, increases your agility, and always delivers current stable Kubernetes and Linux versions.
